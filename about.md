## About Me

I'm a computer Science major at Murray State University. My study habits aren't the best, but when I get enough time to actually use a language, I can pick it up well enough. I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, watching tv, going on walks, and hanging with friends in my spare time.

## Other Places You Can Find Me

I wont be including links here, but on any major gaming platform I go by retrosonic90. Kind of a cheesey name, but I've used it for years. These platforms include: Twitter, Xbox Live, Playstation Network (retrosonic9), the Nintendo Network, Steam, reddit, youtube, and a few other sites.
