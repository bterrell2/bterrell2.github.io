## Other Places You Can Find Me

I wont be including links here, but on any major gaming platform i go by retrosonic90. Kind of a cheesey name, but I've used it for years. These platforms include: Twitter, Xbox Live, Playstation Network (retrosonic9), the Nintendo Network, Steam, reddit, youtube, and a few other sites.
